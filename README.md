# Project Euler Solutions

My solutions to the first 100 problems found on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

This repository was assembled from numerous folders and subfolders across many of my devices.
The solutions were done over the course of about 7 years.

## Programming Languages Used

- Matlab
- Python

## Known Issues
If a solution involves reading in data from a file stored in `./data`, the path is going to be wrong in the solution file.
Please submit an issue, or fix the solution file to access the correct file and submit a pull request.

Many of the source data are missing. I will get to this eventually, but not in the foreseeable future.
The data can be found at projecteuler.net by clicking on the page for the corresponding problem number.

Some of these are not really solutions but attempts at a solution. It should be obvious when that is the case, but it may not be. I will try to update this a list of problems that I have actually solved in the future.
